# MachineLearning
Imports and Setup:
Necessary libraries and modules for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported. Warnings are suppressed to avoid clutter.

Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
The dataset is loaded, and initial exploration is conducted, including checking data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

Data Visualization:
Plots are created to visualize the distribution of stock prices and the relationship between different features.

Feature Engineering:
New features such as 'open-close,' 'low-high,' and 'is_quarter_end' have been created to capture more information about stock price movements.

Data Grouping and Visualization:
Data is grouped by year and quarter-end status to observe patterns.

Target Variable Creation:
A binary target variable is created, indicating whether the next day's closing price is higher than the current day's price.

Correlation Analysis:
A heatmap is created to visualize the correlation between different features.

Feature Standardization and Data Splitting:
Features are standardized, and the dataset is split into training and validation sets.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Three models (Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBClassifier) are trained and evaluated using ROC-AUC scores. The performance on both training and validation sets is printed.

Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix is plotted for the Logistic Regression model to visualize its performance.

Additional Considerations:

Model Selection:
The code uses three different models, which is suitable for comparison. However, it does not employ a hyperparameter tuning step, which could improve model performance.

Data Preprocessing:
The code handles missing values by checking their count but does not explicitly drop or blame them if they exist. This should be addressed.

Performance Metrics:
ROC-AUC is used for evaluation, which is appropriate for binary classification. However, other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score could also provide valuable insights.

Random Seed:
A random seed is set for reproducibility of the train-test split.
